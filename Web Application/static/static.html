    When two symbolic representations of DNA or protein sequences are arranged next to one another so that their most similar elements are juxtaposed they are said to be aligned. Many bioinformatics tasks depend upon successful alignments. Alignments are conventionally shown as a traces. <br>
    A trace can represent a substitution: <br>
    AKVAIL<br>
    AKIAIL<br>
    A trace can represent a deletion:<br>
    VCGMD<br>
    VCG-D<br>
    A trace can represent a insertion:<br>
    GS-K<br>
    GSGK<br>
